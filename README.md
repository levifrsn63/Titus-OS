# Titus OS


**RTL8720DN DEAUTHER**



**How to Upload Firmware / Usage**
Download the Adafruit_BusIO, Adafruit_GFX_Library, & Adafruit_SSD1306. You need to first backup any files that will be replaced, and then add this into your Arduino/libraries folder.

This fixes bugs that make Adafruit SSD1306 library incompatible with BW16 board.
Upload the firmware using the .ino file via Arduino IDE.

Turn it on and select/attack!

You can also connect to web ui (change credentials in code)
